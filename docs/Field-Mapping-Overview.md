**About these documents:**  
Each Field-Mapping Overview aligns the [Minuet Agent Schema](../schema.json) with major agent ecosystems such as LangChain, OpenRouter, and AWS Bedrock AgentCore.  
Mappings are verified against official public documentation and include confidence levels that reflect the strength of that evidence.
